mm.{c,h}
        Malloc package. 

Makefile
        Builds the driver 

mdriver.c
        The malloc driver that tests mm.c file
        
traces/
	Directory that contains the trace files that the driver uses
	Files with names of the form XXX-short.rep
	contain very short traces for debugging.

**********************************
Other support files for the driver
**********************************
config.h	Configures the malloc lab driver
clock.{c,h}	Low-level timing functions
fcyc.{c,h}	Function-level timing functions
memlib.{c,h}	Models the heap and sbrk function
stree.{c,h}     Data structure used by the driver to check for
		overlapping allocations

*******************************
Building and running the driver
*******************************
To build the driver, type "make" to the shell.

To run the driver on a tiny test trace:

	unix> ./mdriver -V -f traces/syn-array-short.rep

To get a list of the driver flags:

	unix> ./mdriver -h

The -V option prints out helpful tracing information
